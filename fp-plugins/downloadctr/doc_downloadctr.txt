Download Counter
================

This is a plugin for FlatPress that adds a BBCode tag "Download" with a link to the file to download and a counter for how many times the file has been downloaded.

To use the plug-in, extract it to the fp-plugins directory, activate the plug-in, and make sure that the fp-content/attachs directory is created and writable by the web server user.

The BBCode for this plugin looks like this:
[download=datei.ext]

It is also possible to specify a name for the link instead of the file name:
[download=file.ext name="my&nbsp;file"]

It is also possible to display the file size by providing a "size" attribute in the BBcode. The following are valid values for the size attribute (lowercase letters work too):
Bytes: [download=file.ext size=B]
Kilobyte: [download=file.ext size=K]
Megabyte: [download=file.ext size=M]
Gigabyte: [download=file.ext size=G]
Terabyte: [download=file.ext size=T]


The plugin assumes that the file to be downloaded is located in the fp-content/attachs directory. The link is generated using the blog base URL.

Note: The directory where the file is stored MUST be writable by the web server user (eg www-data), otherwise the download counter will not be updated.
