FlatPress:
==========
However, this plugin only works in entries. If you want to use the editor with static pages, you need to edit this file:

	Admin/panels/static/admin.static.write.tpl

Find the line with: 

	“{*here will go a plugin hook*}”

And then write:

	{action hook=simple_edit_form}


FAQ:
====
Is CKEditor compatible with bbcode?
Yes. You can use both at same time. However, I recommend to use only one at the same time. 

Can I change the appearance or the range of functions?
Yes, to change the skin or the range of functions, open the file /fp-plugins/ckeditor/res/config.js

The editor also contains a markdown plugin. Can I use this for FlatPress?
Yes, you can. However, the markdown syntax is written in plain text in the FlatPress blog.
It is therefore recommended that you also activate the Markdown plugin for FlatPress.
You can download the plugin from the wiki.
