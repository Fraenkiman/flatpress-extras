=================

Created from a template by Igor Kromin, stylesheet and multilanguage support by Fraenkiman

Description
-----------
This plugin creates a box with a series of links to other posts on the same blog.
The look and feel is configurable via CSS. By default 4 random posts are displayed.
The plugin is written to only show up on individual posts, which means it won't show anything if you look at the main blog page, which shows a list of blog posts.

Note
----
There is a known issue with this plugin that the plugin does not work if there are less than 4 posts in a blog. There may be a simple solution.
